Icon Rules:

- Format: follow existing icon format and styles. Add file to repo, don't use `url`.
- Type: SVG/Vector image (don't cheat; use an actual one, not a bitmap fill).
- Size: 18x18 (if non square icon center then flatten on a square and fix the fill).
- Fill: mono color, transparent.
- Detail: keep detail low, preferably use something the Icon Packs. 
- Unique: make sure it isn't the same/similar icon as any other plugin or built-in setting.
